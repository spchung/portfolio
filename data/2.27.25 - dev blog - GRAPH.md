Today worked on most modelling for a knowledge graph implementation. 

I collected (generated) data for the top 30 ingredients and what each of the TREATS and is CONTRAINDICATED\_FOR.
The generated relationships are:
INGREDIENT - TRESTS -> SKIN\_CONDITION
INGREDIENT - CONTRAINDICATED\_FOR -> SKIN\_CONDITION

all saved in the pg db for now. Will need to migrate to a graph db when i get to it.

NEXT STEPS:
Back to Conversational design:
\- I need to get the chat bot to perform a simple questionnaire before we begin\. 
\- still need to figure out how to flow this conversation\. 

LOGIC:
\- upon NEW CHAT
 \- ask a random question from list
 \- determine if satisfactory
 \- if so move on if not ask again

\- upon partially answered questionnaire
 \- keep asking next question until finish

NOTE:
\- do not stop from answering queries if user ignores the question
\- TRY to ask again the next time user uses a "CHAT" intent query\.
