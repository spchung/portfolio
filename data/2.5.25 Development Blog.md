Implemented vector similarity search with milvus vector db. 
As of this commit, you can search the vector database for products using embedded vector search. For example, using the query "facewash" returns "BioMiracle StarDust Pixie Bubble Mask", "Zoella Beauty Tutti Fruity Foam Sweet Foam Shower Gel 250ml" and "Cloud 9 Magic Capsule Cleanser 80ml - O2 Bubble Facial Cleanser, Sebum Control" 

The results are not perfect because the search has no idea of what class of products its looking for. So its based solely on the similarity between query and the embedding generated form the product title. 

Something I forgot to do is to lemmatise and tokenise the product title before generating the embeddings. So will need to redo the product_title collection in milvus. 

Then I will need to also process the reviews into a collection.

To do:
1. re-dump product_title collection with tokeniser and data preprocessing
2. process reviews into a milvus collection
3. investigate langchain RAG workflow
