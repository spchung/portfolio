Added ContextManager class to API. 

This class by default keeps 3 active contextObject in the pool (number adjustable) and can load a previous context directly form redis. 

Also wrote some tests for this class - should start thinking about writing more tests for this API.

Next:
\- Conversational design
 1\. collect user preferences \(skin\_type\, name \.\.\. etc\)
 2\. running summary and manage interest \(?\)

\- Might need to implement some kind of NER pipeline to extract keywords
