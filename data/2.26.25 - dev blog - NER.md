Big day - implemented NER tagging 

Challenges:
I really wanted to make use of the ingredient that came with the original data set but turned out they were not very good. Because there are a lot of similar ingredient that are just slight variations of itself. This led to a 3k+ list of "uniqlue" ingredients. I tried to perform cluster analysis but the results were only okay and a few groups got like the majority of the ingredients. So then I just ended up using a list generated by an LLM LOL.

NER structure
\- the "metadata" table stores lists of entities the pipeline is allowed to look for \- SKIN\_CONDITION\, SKIN\_DESCRIPTION\, BODY\_PART\, PRODUCT\_INGREDIENT
\- the api uses this as the source of the nlp pipeline \(spaCy\)\. 
\- spacy extracts the entities
\- stores in the context object
\- obtained in the front end

NEXT STEPS:
\- try to work NER into the conversational design
\- add a prompt for additional information
 \- when there are a few entities \-\> use a prompt that will ask user about their skin problems n stuff\.

\- come up with a few questions about the user in the beginning to build up chatbot knowledge \(\!\!\!\)
