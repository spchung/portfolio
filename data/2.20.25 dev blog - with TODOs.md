V2 single shot conversational design is functioning.

Here are a few points to improve on:
1\. Implement dynamic Qdrant paylod filter
 \- This would require a text extraction prompt that extracts terms in the user query that can be used as a filter
 \- e\.g\. "I am looking for a exfoliator with salicylic acid" \-\> here "salicylic acid" can be extracted and used as a payload filter
2\. prompt tuning
 \- overall tone \-\> make it sound more professional
3\. UI 
 \- the response still contains weird shit like "\*\*bolded text\*\*" \-\> can fix in UI

Next Steps:
\- implement context tracking for v2
\- session tracking
