V2 of this project will have most of the same infrastructure but with improved conversational design. The only additional infrastructure would be an external knowledge base. 

This knowledge base will contain two parts:
1\. articles about specific class of products and ingredients and their effects on our skin\. 
2\. a web search feature

The knowledge store will help with questions like
\- "Is XXX ingredient good for someone with dry skin?"
\- "Should I apply XXX product before YYY product"
